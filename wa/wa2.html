            Adam got interested in Computer Science his freshman year of college, after taking his first computer science class "CSCI 1300: Starting Computing". Coding allowed him to use his creativity to solve real world problems. His dream one day is to work for a company as a software engineer or as a video game developer. He has always found video games fascinating especially with the new and improving tevhnology that has recently been coming out. Being a part of something that big would be such a cool experience that he hopes one day to be a part of.
