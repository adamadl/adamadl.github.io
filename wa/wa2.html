            I am a current Sophomore at CU Boulder majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> with a minor in <strong>Creative Technology and Design</strong>. I am currently working as an RA in Sewall Hall. I enjoy playing music and performing in concerts and theatre productions as I have been performing for about 9 years. I have been in many theatre productions including, <em>"Into the Woods"</em>, <em>"Singing in the Rain"</em>, <em>"Lion King"</em>, and <em>"Guys and Dolls"</em>. I am from Fort Collins and has lived there all my life. I love to travel and has been to 9 different countries outside of the US, most notably, Czaech Republic, Hungary, and Austria.
            <br><br>
            My goals for this course is to be able to expand upon what I have learned in Software Development and hopefully create amazing websites that can be used for future use and hopefully for future jobs.
