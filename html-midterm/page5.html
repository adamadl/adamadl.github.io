    <h1>Errors in HTML Code</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On line 23, the opening &lt;li&gt; tag did not have a closing tag, so I added &lt;/li&gt; </li>
        <li>On line 26, the relative path for the image is not correct since the image file is in a different folder, I changed the path to "/html-midterm/img/image.png"</li>
        <li>On line 29, the opening &lt;p&gt; tag did not have a closing tag, so I added &lt;/p&gt; </li>
        <li>On line 35, the opening &lt;td&gt; tage did not have a closing tag, so I added &lt;/td&gt;</li>
        <li>On line 41, there should be a closing &lt;tr&gt; tag for the table, so I added &lt;/tr&gt; </li>
        <li>On line 42, there should be a closing &lt;table&gt; tag to close the table, so I added &lt;/table&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>On line 26, the closing bold tag is done incorrectly, it should be &lt;/b&gt;</li>
        <li>On line 52, the &lt;h3&gt; tag should not be nested in the &lt;b&gt; tag. This is because inline elements can not contain block-level elements, so I nested the &lt;b&gt; inside the &lt;h3&gt;</li>
        <li>On line 56, the href in the anchor tag, "where do I go" is not a valid link, so I changed it to an absolute link</li>
        <li>On line 73, the opening &lt;h6&gt; does not have a closing tag, so I added &lt;/h6&gt;</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start of the html document, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is not there and that is important to tell the computer it is an html document, so I added it to the start</li>
        <li>The head element was missing the required title as well as the meta and css file, so I added them</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start of the html document, &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is not there and that is important to tell the computer it is an html document, so I added it to the start</li>
        <li>On line 37, the opening &lt;td&gt; tag did not have a closing tag, so I added &lt;/td&gt; </li>
        <li>On line 42, the cat image is not in the table because there was no &lt;td&gt; tag around it, so I added the opening and closing &lt;td&gt; tag</li>
        <li>On line 47, the closing &lt;/td&gt; tag did not have an opening tag, so I added &lt;td&gt; at the start of that line</li>
        <li>All images should have alt text to be more accessible to all users, so I added alt text for all images</li>
    </ul>
